# Project Title:
 Automated-Testing-with-Git

# Description:
I have been working on test scripts, custom commands, and test automations in Java Script and Cypress.

# How to Use:
I'm working on testing automations with GitHub. Automation increases efficiency, reduces errors and improves overall performance of a system or process. Automation uses technology to perform tasks without using human intervention. It involves creating systems, processes, or devices that can operate independently to complete specific tasks or sets of tasks. Automation can be used in various industries, such as manufacturing, logistics and information technology to automate repetitive and timeconsuming tasks.
